evere - EVEning REsearch


purpose
=======

evere deals with conducting research in parallel with having a 40-hours job and further responsibilities in life.
The project tries to define invariant aspects of conducting research on topics where Machine Learning techniques can be applied to.
These invariant aspects are tried to be identified at an abstract level; thus allowing future projects to reuse concepts and methodologies identified here.

This project is focused on identifying common workflows and tasks.
IT does not aim at solving concrete problems.
As such, all content contained herein needs to be adapted to individual needs and requirements

required tools and dependencies
===============================

* Asciidoc (for building the documentation,  see http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/)
* the make file system

time schedule
=============

This is a rather coarse-grained time schedule.

2014: gathering initial thoughts and ideas, set up initial structuring of the work; proof of concept implementation

2015 and beyond: extending various aspects
